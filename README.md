# ImageMLResearch
ImageMLResearch is a toolkit to help with image-based machine learning projects using Python. It includes functions for data handling, preprocessing, plotting, and more. These functions are combined into a single `Researcher` class to make experimentation easier and more efficient. Please note that this toolkit is specifically designed for image classification tasks and does not support regression problems.
